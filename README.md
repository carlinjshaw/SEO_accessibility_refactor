# horiseon-refactor-challenge

## Summary
In this assignment I took the HTML and CSS of an application and edited it to meet accesibility standards, 
to have search engine optimization, and to fix any bugs on the page. 
To increase search engine optimization, I made sure there were logical and sequential semantic elements in the HTML that could be read by a screan reader. 
The accesibility was increased by changing the semantic HTML elements and by providing alt"" with descriptions for each image.
