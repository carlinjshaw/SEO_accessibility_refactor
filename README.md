# horiseon-refactor-challenge

## Summary
In this assignment I took the HTML and CSS of an application and edited it to meet accesibility standards, 
to have search engine optimization, and to fix any bugs on the page. 
To increase search engine optimization, I made sure there were logical and sequential semantic elements in the HTML that could be read by a screan reader. 
The accesibility was increased by changing the semantic HTML elements and by providing alt"" with descriptions for each image.

## Commits and logs

Unfortunately I did not follow directions by commiting every so often, as I just recently got accustomed to the Git version process. 
Instead, I kept a log of everything that I did, as shown below:

-added id to the href serach engine link
-changed title to "Horiseon"
-added "alt=""" to images and descriptions
-changed div to header
-added "Why choose us?" to side bar and added styling to center
-consolodated class benefits h3 into 1 class instead of 3
-consolidated class benefits secondary blocks
-changed some divs to sections
-changed divs to footers
-changed div to nav in header
-changed divs to aside
-changed section to main (sections are children)
-consolodated content, benefits, and header styling
-matched CSS class names to semantics in html
